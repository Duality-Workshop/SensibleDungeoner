# SensibleDungeoner
Most dungeon generators on the market only care about the architecture layout. This project aims to generate dungeons while staying true to level design rules.

Upon completion, this will be a free, open-source tool that generates generic 2D dungeon maps.

Current version is a (text-based) prototype that generates a minimum of 5 rooms, up to 20 on average (but can go well past thousands if needed).
